# Reactions
Reactions allow units to perform actions out of the normal activation sequence. Units may attempt a reaction to a few different possible triggers. A unit may only make a reaction if they have not yet taken any actions this round or if they are on Hold. When a unit reacts, it may perform a single action out of sequence. Once it does so, that unit may no longer perform any further actions this round and counts as activated.

## Reaction Triggers
Units may react to the following triggers:
* A unit is targeted by a Shoot action, Fight action or Charge action
* A unit on Hold has an enemy unit start or end a Move action within range of a charge or shooting attack

## Making A Reaction
To make a Reaction, a unit declares they are attempting to react to one of the above triggers and takes an Initiative skill check. If failed, the unit takes 1 Shock and may activate later in the round. If passed, the unit may perform one action after which it counts as activating for the round.

## Reaction Timing
Reactions follow some special timing as they interrupt another unit's activation. 

Timings are described as follows:
* Move, Focus, Evade and Rally actions are performed immediately when a reaction is successful.
* Shoot and Fight are performed simultaneously with the attacking unit.
* Charges are performed before the attacking unit moves, after which both units Fight simultaneously if the unit being reacted to is also charging.
