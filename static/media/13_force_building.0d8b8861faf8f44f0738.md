# Force Building
For a full game, the following force building restrictions apply. For casual or beginner games, feel free to simply pay the points for any units you wish to bring and ignore force building restrictions.

## Points Limit
Players should agree on a Points limit before constructing lists. This can be anywhere from 500-3000+ depending on game time requirements and model availability.
For standard games we recommend 1000 points.

## Legends
Legends are particularly memorable people or weapons. They typically replace or upgrade a unit with a unique ability which cannot be acquired elsewhere.

### Purchasing a Legend
Legends may be purchased using list building points and have a limit to how many may be taken. Typically they will replace an item or unit, or give a unit additional abilities. Players make take one legend per 1000 game points being played. For games under 1000 points, players may each simply take one legend. Each legend also may only be taken once in a list.

__For Example:__ We are playing a 2000 point game, and 2000/1000 = 2 allowed legends. If we are playing a 1000 point game, I am allowed to take 1 legend.

## Force Organizations
Game modules and sometimes game factions each specify restrictions on the number of each type of unit that can be used. First, choose a Force Organization and note down its Tactic Point cost (listed next to its name) in order to bring that organization. Stronger or sometimes larger forces may require spending more of your Tactic Points. The total number of Tactic Points paid for force organizations are subtracted from your Tactic Point income each round. A list may include any number of Force Organizations, so long as your Tactic Points do not go below zero.
### Allied Forces
Some game modules may group factions into allied groups. In this case, you may bring a separate Force Organization (paying its Tactic Point cost) to include an allied faction in your Force. Factions that are in the "Unaligned" category do not have allies and may not take allied detachments. Factions in the "Mercenaries" category may be allied to any faction.
### Force Focus
Focuses are limited or focused version of a specific faction with certain benefits representing a sub-faction of a standard faction. Any force can choose a focus to unlock additional list building opportunities.
### Focus Advantages
Choosing a focus typically unlocks specific strategies for that force, but may come with some trade-offs such as limiting the amount of units you can pick while allowing you access to more powerful versions of specific units. There is no cost for picking a focus other than these potential trade-offs.
