# Movement
Each model in a unit making a Move action may move up to its movement characteristic in any direction. At the end of a unit's move, models in the unit must maintain a 2" coherency and may not be more than 6" away from any other model from the unit. Models may move through other friendly models so long as they do not end their movement on top of any friendly models. Models may not move within 1" of an enemy model unless charging that unit.
## Unit Facing
Units may end their movement in any orientation so long as this does not move the unit beyond its movement characteristic.
## Crossing Low Obstacles
Units crossing an obstacle that is 2" or less in height during their move must take an Initiative skill check. If failed, the unit loses 2" of Movement for that action. If passed, the unit may continue to move without penalty.
## Climbing Terrain
When climbing an obstacle, first measure its height. If a unit does not have enough movement speed to reach the top, it may not attempt to climb.
To climb an obstacle during their move must take an Initiative skill check. If failed, the unit halves its remaining movement. If passed, the unit may continue to move without penalty. If a unit no longer has enough movement distance after failing the test to climb the obstacle it may not do so.
## Leaping Across Gaps
Units may attempt to jump a gap which they have the movement distance to cross. To do this, take an Initiative test. If passed, the gap is successfully crossed. If failed, follow the rules for falling, and place the unit on the surface below the gap.
## Jumping or Falling Down
Jumping or falling units must take an Initiative test if they fall or jump down a height of more than 3". If failed, all models in the unit must take a Save roll. If passed, the unit hits the ground and may continue normally.
