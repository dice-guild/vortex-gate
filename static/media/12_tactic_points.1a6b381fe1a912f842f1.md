# Tactic Points
Tactic Points are a way to add extra flavor by providing limited-used extra abilities. In addition, most game modules allow some dice to be re-rolled to smooth out some match-defining dice rolls.

### Gaining Tactic Points
Players gain Tactic Points at the beginning of each game round. This is your pool of Tactic Points available for the round which may be spent on a variety of game effects depending on the game setting. A player always gains at least 1 Tactic Point per round. Some abilities or effects may allow a player to gain additional Tactic Points. Only one Tactic Point per round may be gained per round by unit or faction abilities, even if multiple effects allow a player to gain Tactic Points. At the end of a round, players discard any remaining Tactic Points meaning they do not carry over from round to round.

### Tactic Point Counts
The amount of Tactic Points players gain per round is dependent on the game size and how many force organizations a player fills out. Players gain a base of 1 Tactic Points per round, and an additional 1 per 500 points played.

__For Example:__ We are playing a 1000 point game, so I would gain 1 base, and 1000/500 = 2 additional Tactic Points per round. If we are playing a 500 point game, we would get 1 base, and 500/500 = 1 additional Tactic Point per round.
### Spending Tactic Points
Each tactic will specify when it may be used. This can include when a unit is targeted by an attack, when a unit is activated, and many more. A unit may only be the target of one tactic per action it takes (Move, Shoot, Focus etc).

### Pre-game Tactics
Some tactics are used before the game begins. You may spend Tactic Points from your first-round Tactic Point income to activate these strategies. Note however, those points will be unavailable for the first game round.
