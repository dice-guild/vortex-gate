# Game Rounds
The following phases are done in order each round after which a new round begins.

## Initiative Phase
In the bidding phase, players will determine who gets to activate the first unit. Both players roll off and the winner may activate one unit first. If both players tie, the player who did not have the initiative last round goes first. If it is still the first round, both players roll off until one player scores higher.

## Actions Phase
Players alternate activating one unit and performing two actions with that unit, starting with the player that won the bidding phase. Play continues until both players have activated all units. When activated, a unit may choose two actions to complete as its activation. They may be done more than once unless otherwise specified.

__Unit Activations:__ A unit may only be activated a single time per round, regardless of any abilities which allow for free activations.

## End Phase
At the beginning of the end phase, both players will remove any leftover action tokens from their units including Focus and Evade tokens. Additionally, players will score any end-of-round VP for the current scenario and resolve abilities which occur at the end of the round.
