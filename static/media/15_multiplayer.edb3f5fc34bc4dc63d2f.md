# Multiplayer Games
The following multiplayer rules are intended to allow players to play on "teams" against one another and to speed up game play while retaining the proper game balance.

## Free-for-all
Free-for-all games are played very similarly to one-on-one games in that each player rolls to gain initiative. All players roll off and in order of the highest, players activate units in that order. If there are any ties players roll-off to determine who will go first.

__For Example:__ There are three players. Player one rolls 5, player two rolls 3 and player three rolls 1. Player one will first, then player two would then activate. Finally, player three would activate one unit. Play then continues in the same order with each player activating one unit until all units are activated.

## Team Games
When playing team games, one player on the team will roll to determine the first team to activate. When activating units, each player on the team will activate one unit, or in the case of imbalanced teams, the players on the smaller team together may activate a number of units equal to the larger team's size.

__For Example:__ There are two teams of two players each. Team one rolls 5 and team two rolls 4. Team one may activate one unit per player and then team two may each activate one unit per player.
